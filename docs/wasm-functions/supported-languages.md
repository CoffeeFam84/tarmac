# Supported Languages

Currently, Tarmac leverages the Web Assembly Procedure Call \([waPC](https://wapc.io/)\) to interact and run WASM Functions. As such, Tarmac is limited to languages that support both Web Assembly and the waPC protocol.

The below table outlines languages that are fully supported.
